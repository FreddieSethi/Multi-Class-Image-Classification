# Multi-Class-Image-Classification

This project aims to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of labeled images to predict the labels for unlabeled images. The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 different classes.

## Task

The task is to explore various CNN algorithms, implement an appropriate CNN algorithm using TensorFlow/Keras and conduct an empirical evaluation to improve the performance of the algorithm. The specific tasks involved are as follows:

Perform an exploratory analysis of various CNN architectures.
Implement a CNN algorithm from scratch using existing software libraries like TensorFlow/Keras.
Conduct at least 10 experiments with different architectures, parameters, hyperparameters, loss functions, regularization techniques, etc.
Present and analyze the results of the experiments in a way understandable by non-technical users.
Draw conclusions and provide specific recommendations for potential improvements to your CNN model and state-of-the-art methods.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this assessment is the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
